This is the perfect example of the sort of trash that comes out of Australian Cinema 9 out of 10 times. I saw this movie on late night TV a couple of years ago and was thoroughly bored. Guess what tonight i turn on the TV and this toilet of a movie starts. Within the first 2 minutes i have sustained a headache from the sheer crapness of it. Now i am writing this. It is just one of those really bad Australian movies which compels you to change the channel immediately, but usually you have to end up watching as nothing else is on. In the same context as one of those stupid British TV dramas (that i cant believe anyone could be bothered watching) although different.
